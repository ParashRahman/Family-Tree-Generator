linear distance idea DISMISSED
quadratic distance can work but when do people move together? When groups force them to.
matching decided through connection network.
x,y element of [0,1]
matching is greedy (like life)

Group creation
- decided by distance
- circular distance random
- people mapped by coordinate blocks for fast access of people
- groups change peoples location

TODO:
-change how people storage works
